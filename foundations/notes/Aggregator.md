## Which data should be obtainedÔºü

swap A to B :

1.  **Discover Relevant Pools:** Find the Uniswap V3 liquidity pools that facilitate swaps between the two tokens the user wants to trade. Remember Uniswap V3 has multiple pools for the same pair, differing by fee tier (e.g., 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%).
2.  **Get Current Pool State for Pricing:** For each relevant pool, fetch the necessary real-time (or near real-time) data to calculate the current exchange rate, estimate the output amount, and determine price impact/slippage.


**I. Essential Data Needed:**

1.  **Pools (`Pool` Entity):** 
    * `id`: The contract address of the pool (essential for identifying the pool).
    * `token0`: Information about the first token in the pair.
        * `id`: Token contract address.
        * `symbol`: Token symbol (e.g., "WETH").
        * `decimals`: Token decimals (crucial for converting amounts).
    * `token1`: Information about the second token in the pair (same fields as `token0`).
    * `feeTier`: The fee percentage for this pool (e.g., "500" for 0.05%, "3000" for 0.3%, "10000" for 1%). Used to identify different pools for the same pair.
    * `liquidity`: The *current* total active liquidity in the pool. This is fundamental for V3 price calculations. Represented as a large integer.
    * `sqrtPrice`: The *current* price of token0 in terms of token1, expressed as a square root (‚àöP) in Q64.96 fixed-point format. Crucial for pricing.
    * `tick`: The *current* price tick the pool is operating at. Also essential for V3 calculations.
    * `totalValueLockedUSD` (Optional but Recommended): Total value locked in the pool in USD. Useful for filtering out insignificant pools or displaying pool stats.
    * `volumeUSD` (Optional): Recent trading volume. Also useful for filtering or stats.

2.  **Tokens (`Token` Entity):** 
    * `id`: Token contract address.
    * `symbol`: Symbol.
    * `name`: Full name.
    * `decimals`: Decimals.

**II. How to Build Queries:**

The most common task is finding relevant pools for a given token pair (e.g., Token A and Token B).

**Strategy:** Query pools that contain *at least one* of the tokens, then filter in your backend. Querying for exact pairs directly using `where: {token0: A, token1: B}` can be cumbersome because you also need the `where: {token0: B, token1: A}` case. A more practical approach:

1.  Query all pools where `token0` is Token A.
2.  Query all pools where `token1` is Token A.
3.  **filter** out pools with very low liquidity (`totalValueLockedUSD` or `liquidity`).


**III. Backend Logic After Querying:**
1.  Combine these results in backend.
2.  Filter the combined list to keep only those pools where the *other* token is Token B.
3.  Use the `liquidity`, `sqrtPrice`, `tick`, `feeTier`, and token `decimals` from these pools in your aggregator's pricing/routing algorithm (likely using a Uniswap V3 SDK or library for the complex math).

### **Fusion Mode**:

is an **intent-based swap** mechanism:

- Instead of executing the swap directly on-chain,  
- The user signs and broadcasts an **intent** like ‚ÄúI want to swap X,‚Äù  
- This creates an **off-chain order** containing a limit price and a minimum acceptable return,  
- Then, a third party on-chain ‚Äî known as a **Resolver** ‚Äî fills the order and completes the swap.

1.1 Linear routing
if a user needs to trade ETH to USDC, the optimal path found by A linear routing is to trade ETH to USDT, then it goes to USDC, not [A-C-B] or [A-D-B] (that is, the asset A is not split into two parts and selects different paths). The chosen path only goes through two pools. These two pools may come from different protocols. For example, the protocol to trade ETH to USDT is from the Uniswap V3 pool, and the USDT-USDC protocol is from the Curve V1 pool. DEX such as Uniswap V2 and PancakeSwap also use this routing model.


At first glance, it seems to be a straightforward problem about the shortest path, and there are many mature algorithms for reference. But unlike the ordinary shortest path problems, in the process of looking for the next edge, under the weight of an edge is associated with the path in front of the sequence of the node. Therefore, in the optimum path of nodes joining the queue, each node has a state that needs to be maintained in real-time. It makes the subsequent sequence nodes of recorded path length match the state of the preceding sequence nodes. And in this problem, the final ‚Äúminimum weight‚Äù is calculated not by summing the weights of all edges on the path but by calculating only the entry weight of the toToken node. This characteristic makes the traditional shortest path algorithm not wholly applicable.

When there are few nodes, it is more intuitive to search with the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm directly, that is, to traverse every path and get the final toToken price, to select the optimal path for users to exchange. The Uniswap V2 route uses this method to find the optimal path. The first version of the Uniswap V3 route uses this method as well.
```

During the DFS traversal, the algorithm also checks for duplicate routes by generating a hash for each route and storing it in a set. This allows the algorithm to keep track of unique routes and avoid storing duplicate paths, further enhancing efficiency.
